# PRD — JARVIS Trading System (monorepo)

## Services in this repo

| Service | Folder | Type | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| JARVIS dashboard | `/app/backend` + `/app/frontend` | FastAPI + React (Emergent) | Command dashboard, runs the JARVIS Claude brain, 40 tools |
| forex-agent | `/app/forex-agent` | Python worker (Railway) | OANDA paper-trading bot, Telegram command bot (polls) |
| kronos-agent | `/app/kronos-agent` | Python worker (Railway) | Runs Kronos forecaster on OANDA candles, sends signals to Telegram |
| knowledge-arb | `/app/knowledge-arb` | Python worker (Railway) | Tavily + Claude narrative-emergence scout, sends signals |

All three Railway services share one Telegram bot (`@Jervistradebot`, token `8694341880:...`). Only **forex-agent** polls; kronos-agent and knowledge-arb are send-only → no 409 conflicts.

## forex-agent

See previous PRD entry. 8 deterministic guardrails, 10/10 tests passing, Claude Sonnet tool loop, APScheduler + Telegram polling, SIGTERM-graceful shutdown. Railway-ready.

**Status:** Pushed to GitHub. Live Railway deploy pending successful `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` paste (last reported error was `InvalidToken` from a fat-fingered paste — re-paste `8694341880:AAGAaezBo2t3ZlTyJSB6g-NreqkSkTiM9pk` in Railway Variables).

## kronos-agent (new 2026-05-03)

Signal-only Railway worker. No trading.

- **Model:** `NeoQuasar/Kronos-small` (~25M params, CPU-OK), `NeoQuasar/Kronos-Tokenizer-base`. Cached at `/hf_cache`.
- **Data:** OANDA practice candles (read-only), H1 granularity, 360h lookback, 24h forecast, 20 Monte-Carlo samples.
- **Signal logic:** `upside_prob = share of predicted steps above current price`; `vol_amp = predicted_std / historical_std`. Thresholds configurable (default 0.65 / 0.35, max_vol_amp 2.0).
- **Schedule:** `0 */4 * * 1-5` (every 4h Mon-Fri, UTC).
- **Output:** Telegram message with direction (BUY/SELL/SKIP), confidence (high/medium/low), price targets, upside probability, vol amplification.

Files: `config.py`, `oanda_fetch.py`, `kronos_client.py` (lazy-loads model), `signal.py`, `main.py`. `Dockerfile` clones the Kronos repo + adds `/app/Kronos` to PYTHONPATH. Lint clean.

## knowledge-arb (new 2026-05-03)

Signal-only Railway worker. Narrative-emergence scout.

- **Input:** `WATCHLIST` comma-separated topics.
- **Fetch:** Tavily news (24h window) + general (7d window), counts + titles + domains + snippets per topic.
- **Score:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 with strict JSON-only scoring prompt → `{stage, confidence 1-10, thesis, tickers (up to 5), risks}`.
- **Alert condition:** `stage ∈ {pre-emerging, emerging, breakout}` AND `confidence ≥ MIN_CONFIDENCE`. 7-day per-(topic, stage) cooldown.
- **Schedule:** `0 */6 * * *` (every 6h).

Files: `config.py`, `scout.py` (Tavily), `scorer.py` (Claude), `state.py` (cooldown), `main.py`. Lint clean. **Live smoke-tested** 2026-05-03 — Tavily + Claude both reached real APIs, scored "AI agents" as emerging/6, "small modular reactors" as pre-emerging/3, no alerts sent (below threshold — correct behavior).

## Deploy plan

Three separate Railway services, same GitHub repo, different Root Directories:

1. `forex-agent` — Root Directory `forex-agent`
2. `kronos-agent` — Root Directory `kronos-agent`
3. `knowledge-arb` — Root Directory `knowledge-arb`

Each service pastes its own env vars. Credentials can be shared (same Anthropic/Tavily/OANDA/Telegram keys).

## Backlog

- **P0 user action:** Push the two new services to GitHub (Save to GitHub button). Add two Railway services. Verify first alerts land in Telegram.
- **P1:** Move from single-bot-shared-token to per-service bots if signal channels get noisy.
- **P2:** Kronos upgrade to `Kronos-base` on a GPU host if medium-term accuracy matters more than cost.
- **P2:** knowledge-arb v2 — add Reddit + Google Trends as secondary signals beyond Tavily.
- **P2:** Shared MongoDB so kill-switch / cooldown / daily-halt state survives Railway redeploys.
